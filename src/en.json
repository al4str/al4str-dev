  "xp.jan-2023-present.position": "“Umain AB”, Stockholm, Sweden, Senior frontend developer",
  "xp.jan-2023-present.feat-1": "As part of the McDonald's account team, I became responsible for 2 main frontend projects. First one is a huge internal management tool, which is used by more than 60 global markets to manage various business entities, like restaurants, deliveries, products, codes, etc. Unfortunately, project uses obsolete framework and deprecated libraries and the whole codebase could be described as a big spaghetti mess. Eventually, got permission from stakeholders to start a separate project alongside the existing one. Our task is to move modules section by section to modern JavaScript, the freshest version of a framework (which won't be abandoned in recent years), only essential hard-to-diy dependencies (like, timezones or uuid generation), with up-to-date approach to coding, structuring and with performance in mind. The work is still going.",
  "xp.jan-2023-present.feat-2": "Second project has a much smaller scope, but is user-facing meaning, that is used by regular people, McDonald's customers. This one was over-engineered, over-complicated, bloated with unnecessary heavy-weight 3rd-party dependencies for single-page application, which sole purpose is to be a landing page for mobile application + handling McD customer's personal data and notification settings. Within a few months rewrote and updated project's source code: restructured, made more readable, added type safety, reduced repetition, simplified logic. After refactoring, any following updates to the code now are a pleasure to make, it is much easier to find place you need to update, plus you know, that this change won't break any other part of the app.",

Refactored and optimized the app, raising the *Google Pagespeed Insights* score from 15+ to 85+. Initiated a full *TypeScript* transition, rewrote over 80% of the project into strongly typed code in 5 months, not stopping delivery of new features, which improved the team's time to market and reduced their time of fixing common bugs during QA reviews. Rewrote and replaced the heaviest 3rd-party libraries, optimized and split the code, which led to every page bundle reduction from 400kb+ to less than 100kb.",
  "xp.aug-2021-dec-2022.feat-2": "Crafted a CLI tool to automatically generate API methods and associated types from *Swagger*.
